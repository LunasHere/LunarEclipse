Last Updated: 10/23/2025

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how the LunarEclipse Discord Bot (‚Äúthe Bot‚Äù, ‚Äúthe Service‚Äù) ‚Äî developed and maintained by Luna (‚Äúthe Developer‚Äù, ‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúus‚Äù) ‚Äî collects, stores, and uses data.

By using the Bot, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, you must remove the Bot from your server and discontinue its use.

## 2. Information We Collect

LunarEclipse only collects limited, non-sensitive data necessary for functionality and moderation.
The types of information that may be collected include:

a. Automatically Collected Data

When the Bot operates in your server, it may collect and temporarily store:

User IDs (for identifying who used a command or triggered an event)

Server IDs and Channel IDs (to apply settings or features per server)

Message IDs (for moderation commands like warn, mute, delete, or logs)

Command usage data (used for debugging and improving the Bot)

b. Configuration Data

When server administrators use setup or configuration commands, the Bot may store:

Feature toggles (e.g., moderation, logging, or leveling system enabled)

Custom prefixes or role IDs for permissions

Channel IDs for specific features (e.g., welcome messages, logs)

c. No Sensitive or Personal Data

The Bot does not collect or store:

Message contents (except in moderation logs if configured by the server owner)

Email addresses, passwords, or billing information

Any data outside of Discord‚Äôs API

## 3. How We Use the Data

The collected information is used only to:

Provide and operate the Bot‚Äôs features

Maintain server-specific settings and preferences

Prevent abuse, spam, or misuse

Diagnose technical issues and improve performance

Data is never sold, rented, or shared with third parties.

## 4. Data Storage and Retention

Data is stored in secure databases or configurations managed by the Developer.

Only data necessary for the Bot‚Äôs operation is stored.

If the Bot is removed from a server, related configuration data may be automatically deleted after a reasonable period.

Users or server owners may request data deletion at any time (see Section 7).

## 5. Data Sharing

The Developer does not share any stored data with external organizations, advertisers, or analytics providers.
Data may be disclosed only if required by law or to comply with a valid legal process.

## 6. Third-Party Services

The Bot interacts with the Discord API, provided by Discord Inc.
Use of Discord itself is subject to Discord‚Äôs Privacy Policy.
We are not responsible for the collection or use of data by Discord or other third-party services you use in combination with the Bot.

## 7. Your Rights & Data Deletion

You have the right to:

Request to view or delete any data associated with your user or server.

Remove the Bot from your server at any time, which stops all data collection.

To request deletion, contact the Developer via the information in Section 9.
Requests will typically be processed within 7 days.

## 8. Security

We take reasonable steps to protect stored data from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure.
However, no online service is completely secure. By using the Bot, you acknowledge that data transmission and storage involve some inherent risk.
